# Lab 21 - Last Prime

Complete the function `largest_prime_below` so that it **returns** the largest prime number less than the number passed to it.  

You may want to write a helper function (perhaps to check if a number is prime or not).  Remember, Python reads the file from top to bottom and can only call functions it has already seen.  This means that any helper functions should be above where they are called.

### Testing ###
